Hello, Sir! this is Maria. I am belong to group#18 with Yuka and Kevin.
I just want to say Thank you so much for your dedication in teaching this javaScript Frameworks subject.
I really appreciate your different and effective method of teaching especially in coding.
I apologize to asked you for the first time to extend the deadline a little time.
I was just thinking that I cannot able to make it before the due date, since I had a tight schedule these fast few days.
I miscalculated the time needed to do my schoolworks.
